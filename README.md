# fprime-featherm4-freertos-reference

## Overview

Welcome to fprime-featherm4-freertos-reference, a repository that contains a complete FSW reference for a system that uses the <a href="https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/">F' Flight Software Framework</a> on a featherM4 board with the <a href="https://www.freertos.org/">FreeRTOS</a> open-source RTOS for microcontrollers and small microprocessors. This repository is designed to be paired with platform, board, and OS specific repositories to build F' systems. Eventually, there will be more detail on how you can clone, compile, and flash this reference deployment to a featherM4 board. For now, more detail can be found in the other relevant repositories for the featherm4-freertos platform:

- fprime-featherm4-freertos-reference (this repository) - an example of a basic build using a specific platform
    - <a href=https://github.com/laboratory10/fprime-featherm4-freertos>fprime-featherm4-freertos</a> - a platform repository which is defined by a combination of board and OS
        - <a href=https://github.com/laboratory10/fprime-featherm4>fprime-featherm4</a> - board-specific platform/toolchain/driver files
        - <a href=https://github.com/laboratory10/fprime-freertos>fprime-freertos</a> - a port connecting the F' OSAL to FreeRTOS
